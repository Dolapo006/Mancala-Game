This game is called Mancala. It seems easy but requires a lot of critical thinking and planning in order to win. For years I have played this game with my brother and had my fair share of wins and losses.
Today you also get to experience the game with me in real time.

The rules of the game are simple, each player must take turns in grabbing beads from which ever hole and distribute it accordingly from left to right.
If you end at a hole with other beads you grabs everything in that hole else you grab nothing. 
At the end of game, the player with the most beads wins and another round may begin.
